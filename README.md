# Dwarf Fortress raws

---

This repository has all the raw files for [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/older_versions.html), for most of the releases of Dwarf Fortress. Each release has its own tag so you can easily navigate in the repository and check the state of the raw file at almost any given state of the game.

# What to do with this repo?

I see two main uses to this repository:

- it gives you the ability to see the state of the raw files without having to download the specific version.

- more usefully, it enables you to see the changes in the raws between two versions. For example, if you want to see the changes between the version 0.43.05 and the newer version 0.44.02, you could do this: https://github.com/niezbop/DwarfFortress-raws/compare/0.43.05...0.44.02 ! More generally going to https://github.com/niezbop/DwarfFortress-raws/compare/{oldVersion}...{newerVersion} will show you the differences.
